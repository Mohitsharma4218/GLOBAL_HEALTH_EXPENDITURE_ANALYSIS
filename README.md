# Power BI Project: Global Health Expenditure Analysis

## Overview
Explore global health expenditure data to gain insights into health spending worldwide. Analyze key metrics like health expenditure, GDP, and population across countries and regions. 

## Objective
Analyze global health expenditure data to provide data-driven insights into health spending worldwide. Answer critical questions and support decision-making in global healthcare.

## Data Source
We'll use a dataset with these columns:
- **CountryID**: Unique country identifier.
- **Country**: Name of the country or region.
- **YearID**: Unique year identifier.
- **Year**: Year of the data record.
- **Health Expenditure**: Total health expenditure in US dollars.
- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product in US dollars.
- **Population**: Total population of the country or region.

## Project Steps

### Data Loading and Modeling
1. Import and clean the dataset in Power BI.
2. Create a well-structured data model with appropriate relationships between tables.
3. Ensure all columns have the correct data types.

### Data Analysis using DAX Functions
4. Create a consolidated table using DAX for multi-table information.
5. Identify countries/regions with the highest and lowest health expenditure for all years.
6. Calculate health expenditure as a percentage of GDP for each country.
7. Compute the average health expenditure per capita for each country/region.

### Visualizations
8. Calculate year-to-year percentage change in health expenditure.
9. Determine the average annual growth rate of health expenditure over a selected period.
10. Create a line chart to visualize health expenditure trends over the years for selected countries/regions.
11. Design a bar chart to compare health expenditure across countries/regions for the year 2020.
12. Utilize a scatter plot to explore the relationship between health expenditure and GDP.
13. Use a map visualization to display health expenditure geographically.

### Insights and Conclusions
14. Summarize key findings from the analysis.
15. Draw meaningful conclusions about global health expenditure trends.

### Report and Dashboard
16. Create a well-structured report with relevant visualizations and explanations.
17. Design an interactive dashboard for end-users to explore the data.
18. Ensure user-friendliness and accessibility with slicers or filters for easy data exploration.

Remember to document each step thoroughly and use best practices in data visualization and storytelling. Make the report and dashboard user-friendly for the audience to derive valuable insights from the data.
